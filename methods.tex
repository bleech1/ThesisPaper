\section{Survey}
\label{sec:survey}
To begin exploring how securely local inter-process communication is used, I first needed to find out what applications use local IPC resources.  To do so, I created a ``survey'' and sent it to over 250 people to run on their computers.  I received 22 responses, representing roughly an 8.5\% response rate.  The survey ran on each person's computer, taking observations roughly over a two day period.  The survey is made up of a shell script that makes each observation and outputs the data to files, in addition to two python scripts which were used to anonymize the data and find the process and user owning the other end of UNIX domain sockets, pipes, and fifos.  This survey gathered information about all open pipes, named pipes, UNIX domain sockets, TCP sockets, and UDP sockets.  The tool used to find this information is called \texttt{lsof} which stands for list open files.

For each computer, there were eleven files collected.  One file contained the anonymized output of the \texttt{ps} command, which describes all of the processes currently running on the machine.  This data is used to connect helper processes with the application that they work for.  I also collected the anonymized raw output of \texttt{lsof} after filtering for a specific type of local IPC.  Therefore, there are five files containing this data, one each for anonymous pipes, named pipes, UNIX domain sockets, TCP sockets and UDP sockets.  In addition, for each of these types of local IPC, there is another file that represents how many of each type a process has open at one time.  For example, instead of six lines showing the different UNIX domain sockets that Spotify has open at one time, one observation in this file would have the process name, Spotify, and the number of local sockets, 6, without any of the other information outputted by \texttt{lsof}.

All identifying information was anonymized, and the files were automatically uploaded to my directory on the Middlebury Computer Science Department's machine, basin.
