\begin{abstract}
Local inter-process communication allows processes on the same computer to share data.  However, even though this communication stays within a single computer, best-practices for computer security must still be followed.  In this thesis, I investigate the security of local inter-process communication for four different applications.  I find one bug in parsing input that causes an extension to crash.  Additionally, I can create two Denial-of-Service attacks that prevent a user from opening an application and using the Internet.

\begin{acknowledgements}
I'd like to thank my advisor, Pete, for all of his help this semester.  This project would not have been a success without his advice and guidance throughout the semester.  I'd also like to thank the people who took my survey, which helped inform my decision of what applications to investigate.  Finally, I want to thank my friends and family who supported me throughout the semester, especially those who helped run some of my tests as time was running out.
